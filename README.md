**Important Note on Authentication:**

The backend server and database are hosted on free-tier platforms (Render for the backend and Neon DB for the database). These services may go into an inactive state due to inactivity, which can temporarily affect authentication. If you encounter issues logging in, please try again after a short delay.

If you successfully authenticate, feel free to explore all the features Easy Repo has to offer!
