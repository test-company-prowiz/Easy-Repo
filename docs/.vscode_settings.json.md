# .vscode/settings.json

### Overview
This file defines workspace-specific settings for Visual Studio Code, primarily configuring behavior for installed extensions.

### Architecture & Role
This file resides at the development environment layer. It is a configuration artifact for the VS Code editor and does not directly interact with the application's runtime architecture. Its role is to standardize or customize editor behavior for developers working within the repository.

### Key Components
The file contains a single configuration property:
*   `java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration`: A setting for the Java extension.

### Execution Flow / Behavior
When VS Code is opened to this workspace, the Java extension reads the `java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration` setting. A value of `"interactive"` means that if the build configuration changes (e.g., `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` updates), the user will be prompted to decide whether to update the Java language server's project configuration.

### Dependencies
This file is functionally dependent on:
*   **Visual Studio Code**: The editor itself, which parses and applies these settings.
*   **VS Code Java Extension**: Specifically, the extension providing Java language support, as the setting `java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration` is proprietary to it.

### Design Notes
The decision to set `java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration` to `"interactive"` provides a balance between automation and developer control. It prevents automatic, potentially disruptive, updates to the Java build configuration, instead requiring explicit user confirmation. This can be beneficial in complex multi-module projects or during active build script development, where unintended reconfigurations might occur. An alternative (`"automatic"`) would update silently, while (`"disable"`) would require manual triggering.
